# The chess queens problem...

You're asked to "safely" place eight (8) queens on a chess game. "Safely" because there must be
only one queen per line, one queen per column and one queen per diagonal...
How many solutions are possible ?
   
Of course, no need for a microcontroller to find the solutions to this problem. You can simply
port the code to your favorite development platform and build it!
